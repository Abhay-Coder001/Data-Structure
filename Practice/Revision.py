# 2. What is the difference between for and while loops? Give an example of each. For Loop
# don't need any condition first to print a number or output where while loop runs based on condition which we define '

# 3. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a while loop.
# 5*4*3
# facto = num * num - 1
